B3 is a horizontally scaled, hyper-operable gaming ecosystem designed to address the fragmentation and complexity of onchain gaming. Unlike traditional gaming platforms or isolated blockchain networks, B3 operates as a Layer 3 solution on top of Base, leveraging its low-cost, high-speed transactions to create a modular, scalable infrastructure for games, apps, and enterprises. The platform’s mission is to bridge the gap between Web2 and Web3 gaming, making it easy for players to dive into onchain games without the usual barriers like complex wallet setups or network switching.

B3’s game discovery platform, BSMNT.fun (https://bsmnt.fun/), serves as the entry point for players, offering access to a growing library of games from top developers like Mighty Bear Games, Parallel, and Infinigods. With over 367,000 wallets created and 47 million transactions processed during its testnet phase in just one month, B3 has already demonstrated significant traction and potential.
